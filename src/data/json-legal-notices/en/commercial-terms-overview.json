You may choose to pay this amount either upfront or in installments during the purchase process.\n- **Membership**: We offer membership through a subscription model, allowing you to choose how often you're billedâ€”monthly or annually. We might also provide the option to pay a lump sum upfront.\n\nPlease note, prices are subject to change with a 30-day notice before the next billing period. All listed fees do not include taxes, which are your responsibility. Changes in tax rates could affect your final payment amount.\n\n## Duration of Membership\n\nYour membership will begin once you receive your test results and will continue without interruption unless you decide to cancel.
