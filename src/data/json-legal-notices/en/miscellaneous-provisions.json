It’s crucial for a smooth operation and understanding of expectations on both sides.\n\n## Notices\n\n**GUTRICIOUS** communicates primarily through email for official notices, but you might also find important information posted on our website, through our mobile apps, or other parts of our Service. For any notice to be considered legally valid when you send it to us, it must follow the guidelines set out here. Reach out to us regarding these Terms at:\n\nEmail: [hello@GUTRICIOUS.com](mailto:hello@GUTRICIOUS.com)\n\n## Governing Law\n\nThe legal framework governing our agreement and your use of the Service is based on the laws of the Netherlands, deliberately excluding any principles that might lead to the application of another jurisdiction's laws. Should any legal matter arise, the courts of the Netherlands will have exclusive jurisdiction, which you agree to unconditionally.\n\n## Severability\n\nIn the event a court finds any part of these Terms to be invalid or unenforceable, that part will be adjusted only as much as necessary to make it valid, allowing the rest of the Terms to remain effective and intact.\n\n## Non-assignment\n\nYour rights and duties under these Terms cannot be handed off or transferred to someone else without our written permission. However, **GUTRICIOUS** retains the right to assign these Terms freely.\n\n## Relationship of the Parties\n\nEngaging with **GUTRICIOUS** does not forge any form of partnership, employment, or agency link between you and us. It's important to understand the nature of our interaction.\n\n## Waiver\n\nA waiver regarding any part of these Terms does not imply a waiver of any other part. Furthermore, if **GUTRICIOUS** doesn't exercise a right provided under these Terms, it doesn’t mean we’ve waived that right.\n\n## Force Majeure\n\nNeither of us is responsible for not meeting obligations if hindered by events beyond reasonable control, like pandemics, government actions, or natural catastrophes, to name a few.\n\n## Entire Agreement\n\nThe full breadth of our agreement with you encompasses these Terms, any specific consent forms you’ve accepted, and our Privacy Policy\n. Together, they replace all previous understandings or agreements, be they spoken or written.\n\n## No Third Party Beneficiaries\n\nThese Terms are designed for our mutual benefit and do not grant rights to anyone else, except for the arbitration and indemnification clauses that extend protections to **GUTRICIOUS**’s staff."
