By accepting these Terms, you acknowledge and consent to the following under United States law:\n\n## Authorization to Share Personal Data\n\nYou hereby grant **GUTRICIOUS** the permission to share your personal information, which includes Customer Information, Sample data, test data, Test Data, Self-reported Health Information, and any medical details, with laboratories and their physicians. This disclosure is essential for the effective delivery of the Service.\n\n## Authorization for Documentation Signing\n\nFurthermore, you empower **GUTRICIOUS** to sign on your behalf any documents necessary to facilitate these services, ensuring a seamless and efficient process.\n\n### **Your Explicit Agreement**\n\nBy agreeing to these Terms, you explicitly authorize **GUTRICIOUS** to use and disclose your health information as detailed above.
